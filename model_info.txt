1) 🎯 Objective (What we are building)

We are building a demand forecasting model that predicts Aadhaar service workload for the next 1–3 months, so UIDAI can:

allocate operators (staffing planning)

prepare camps / kits in advance

identify future stress hotspots

improve Aadhaar system efficiency and citizen service delivery

Instead of forecasting only enrolments or only updates, we forecast a combined operational KPI:

✅ ASSI (Aadhaar Service Stress Index)

2) 📌 Key Concept: What is ASSI?

ASSI measures total Aadhaar service workload at a location:

ASSI formula:
𝐴
𝑆
𝑆
𝐼
=
0.5

ASSI=0.5⋅Enrolment+0.3⋅DemographicUpdates+0.2⋅BiometricUpdates

Interpretation:

Enrolment is highest effort (full Aadhaar creation process)

Demographic updates are medium effort

Biometric updates are smaller but important periodic workload

So forecasting ASSI directly predicts service center stress/load.

3) ✅ Why Forecasting ASSI matters (Impact)

UIDAI wants “predictive indicators” + “system improvement”.

Forecasting ASSI helps:

predict peak demand months

forecast stress hotspots

reduce overcrowding & delays through proactive planning

4) 📂 Inputs (What data is used)

We DO NOT train on forecast output CSVs.

We train on historical master dataset:

Required Input File:

./outputs/master_monthly.csv

Expected columns:

month_year (YYYY-MM)

state

district

pincode

enrol_total

demo_total

bio_total

assi ✅ (target variable)

Optional columns (if available):

upr

assi_mom

vol6

5) 🎯 Forecasting Task Definition
Target:

Predict ASSI

Horizon:

Forecast next:

1 month (most actionable)

up to 3 months (planning horizon)

Granularity:

We forecast only top hotspots to keep results stable and useful.

We will forecast:
✅ top 20 pincodes or districts by mean ASSI

Input list comes from:

./outputs/tables/top25_mean_assi.csv

6) 🧠 Models Used (What approach we follow)

We use a 2-model setup:

Model A — Baseline (for benchmark)

✅ Simple Moving Average (SMA-3)

𝑦

𝑒

=mean(y
t
	​

,y
t−1
	​

,y

	​

)

Purpose:

provides a baseline benchmark

used to show improvement

Model B — Main Model (high impact)

✅ Prophet Forecasting Model (recommended)

Prophet learns:

trend

seasonal patterns

local changes (changepoints)

Prophet output includes:

prediction (yhat)

confidence interval (yhat_lower, yhat_upper)

7) 📌 Training workflow (How to implement)
Step 1 — Load data

Read master_monthly.csv

Convert month_year to date:

ds = month_year + '-01' converted to datetime

Prophet requires:

ds = date column

y = target column (ASSI)

Step 2 — Select hotspots

Select top 20 from:

top25_mean_assi.csv

If not available:
Compute mean ASSI by (state, district, pincode) and select top 20.

Step 3 — Backtesting (mandatory)

To show model quality, evaluate using time-based split:

Train set: all months except last 2 months

Test set: last 2 months

Train Prophet on train set.
Predict test set.
Compute error.

8) ✅ Evaluation metrics

Use forecasting metrics:

SMAPE (preferred)
𝑆
𝑀
𝐴
𝑃
𝐸
=
100
%
𝑛
∑
∣
𝑦
−

	​

∑
(∣y∣+∣
y

	​

∣)/2
∣y−
y

	​

∣
	​


Why:

stable even when values are small

Optionally:

MAPE (with +1 stabilization)

We will report:

Prophet SMAPE

baseline SMA SMAPE

9) 📤 Outputs (What files to generate)
Output 1 — Forecast table (Top hotspots)

./outputs/tables/forecast_top_hotspots_prophet_3m.csv

Columns:

state, district, pincode

forecast_month

yhat (predicted ASSI)

yhat_lower

yhat_upper

Output 2 — Next month hotspot ranking

./outputs/tables/top10_predicted_hotspots_next_month.csv

Ranking based on highest predicted ASSI for next month.

Output 3 — Model evaluation

./outputs/tables/model_backtest_scores.csv

Columns:

state, district, pincode

smape_prophet

smape_baseline

Output 4 — Forecast plots (for PDF)

Generate plots for top 5 hotspots:
./outputs/figures/forecast_hotspot_1.png ... forecast_hotspot_5.png

Each plot includes:

historical ASSI line

forecast line

confidence interval band

Also generate Prophet components plot for 1 hotspot:
./outputs/figures/prophet_components_example.png

10) 📌 Interpretation (What we will write in report)

We will mention:

Forecast identifies expected next-month hotspots

Confidence intervals show uncertainty

UIDAI can use rankings to allocate resources

Peak month calendar can guide camp scheduling

11) ✅ How this connects to our full hackathon project

Other modules already produce:

ASSI hotspot rankings

Emerging hotspots (growth)

Volatility zones

Anomaly detection

This forecasting model adds:
✅ predictive indicator
✅ actionable hotspot ranking for next month
✅ operational planning capability

This covers UIDAI evaluation criteria strongly.







2nd explantion in short 





Forecast ASSI (Aadhaar Service Stress Index) for the top 20 hotspots (pincode/district) for the next 3 months using Prophet (and compare with a simple Moving Average baseline).

Inputs: ./outputs/master_monthly.csv + ./outputs/tables/top25_mean_assi.csv
Outputs needed:

forecast_top_hotspots_prophet_3m.csv (with yhat + confidence intervals)

top10_predicted_hotspots_next_month.csv

model_backtest_scores.csv (SMAPE Prophet vs baseline)

5 forecast plots for top hotspots

Let me know once you start — I’ll integrate it into the final PDF.

Option 2 (Clear + detailed)

Hey! I need you to handle the Forecasting Model module for our UIDAI hackathon project.

✅ What to build

A Demand Forecasting Engine to predict Aadhaar service workload using:
Target: ASSI (Aadhaar Service Stress Index = 0.5enrol + 0.3demo + 0.2*bio)

✅ Why

This will be our “predictive indicator” section (high marks: Technical + Impact). UIDAI can use it for staffing/camp planning.

✅ Data

Use:

./outputs/master_monthly.csv (historical monthly ASSI per location)

./outputs/tables/top25_mean_assi.csv (select top 20 hotspots)

Prophet expects: ds (date) + y (ASSI)

✅ Required work

Select top 20 unique hotspots (state/district/pincode)

For each hotspot:

train Prophet

forecast next 3 months

Backtesting:

train = all months except last 2

test = last 2 months

metric = SMAPE

Compare against baseline:

3-month moving average forecast
